# Python Pracitce Problems

This repository is a collection of python practice problems from interview questions, code katas, pyjam, or anything I felt was interesting. Each .py file has a corresponding test file located in /tests as well as a readme.md to explain the problem.

You can run all tests by entering:
`py.test`

or running a specific test by entering:
`py.test tests/test_name_file.py`

At first pass I attempt to solve the practice problem as quickly as possible and adhere to a [shameless green](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/sample/#_shameless_green) philosiphy.

I will then attempt to optimize the practice problem in regards to space and time by adding much larger test cases and provide benchmarking.

I will eventually be breaking down my process on my website: [scottyabrown](https://scottyabrown.com)

Thanks for visiting.
